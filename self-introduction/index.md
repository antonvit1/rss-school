- Hello! My name is Anton and I’m a junior frontend developer.
  I graduated from Belarusian National Technical University and received a master’s degree. My specialty was internal combustion engines.

- After university I worked on different company’s such as ArtMash, Packing Center, Plastick Technologies. I created different 3d models.

- At this time I don’t have a job. I am studding in RS School courses and English courses. Learning front-end developing is very interesting because of constantly changing tasks. It is very good because you need always learning and looking for new solution. After almost six months study I understand my past solves were not very good. But now I can improve them and that’s great.
- I decided to change my sphere of work and become a programmer to have an ability work from any countries. This profession gives me a chance to solve different interesting tasks. There is a need to learn English well and use it.

- In future I am going to learn Java script and react library. After that my plan is to learn Node. Then looking far ahead I would like to learn python language.

* My last project was game minesweeper. It is a project from RS School. The purpose of it is creation of the game with the same functionality as the original game.
* The technologies stack was JavaScript and CSS. One of the most difficult tasks at this project was opening neighboring cells if we click on cell without near her bomb. But it was very interesting find a solution! Besides in the project it was needed to add sound effects, saving recent games, add an ability for user to change the theme of the application.

- In the conclusion I think I have successfully completed all requirements of the task. I guess I made this project not bad, but many details can be simplified and improved.

- Thank you for your attention! Goodbye!
